## Learning React-Redux with useSelector and useDispatch hooks

# Main purpose of this project is to learn how to use React-Redux as an alternative to the useContext + useReducer hooks to manage state variables/objects as many companies are still using Redux.

# Using react-redux allows any components, even deeply nested components to access/manage state variables or objects without having to pass the state variables/objects as props across multiple components.

# Doing so, will promote cleaner codes as certain components may not need the state variables/objects, but still have to inherit/pass on the props to other components (without the use of state management tools like react-redux/useContext + useReducer hooks)

# Dependancies used includes

- axios
- react-redux
- redux-devtools-extension
- redux-logger
- redux-thunk
